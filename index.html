        <h1>Hi, I'm Manthra.</h3>
        <h3>I use neuroscience to build intuitive interfaces.</h3>
        <p>I often get asked what neuroscience and UX design have in common. For me, the two are inextricably tied. My interests have always lied in analyzing human behavior and cognition, from seeking explanations about how we make decisions, to applying them to concrete design strategies. I graduated from the University of Southern California with a major in neuroscience and a minor in user experience,  determined to integrate art and science to create intuitive and enjoyable products. My interdisciplinary background gives me a unique and intentional approach to problem-solving. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm interested in user experience design and strategy, user interface design, brand strategy and consumer behavior analysis.</li>
        <li> My hobbies: Iâ€™ve been playing the piano for 18 years, and love reading about the intersection of music and psychology. </li>
